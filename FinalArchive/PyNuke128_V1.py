WARNINF!
THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY!
THIS FORK BOMB CAN CAUSE SEVERE DAMAGE TO A SERVER, AND TAKE IT OFFLINE
DO *NOT* USE THIS TO TAKE DOWN A SERVER LIKE GOOGLE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HATE THEM
THIS WILL NOT ONLY TAKE THE SERVER DOWN, BUT POSSIBLY DAMAGE THE HARDWARE
YOU WOULD NOT IMAGINE HOW MUCH DAMAGE THIS WOULD CAUSE
SO *DON'T* *DO* *IT!*
*THIS* *IS* *YOUR* *FINAL* *WARNING*
NOTE: There are also some extra steps involved, including preventing the server from terminating the script, and other workarounds that aren't covered in this program.
